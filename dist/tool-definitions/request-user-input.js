Send a question to the user via a pop-up command prompt. **Crucial for clarifying requirements, confirming plans, or resolving ambiguity.**
You should call this tool whenever it has **any** uncertainty or needs clarification or confirmation, even for trivial or silly questions.
Feel free to ask anything! **Proactive questioning is preferred over making assumptions.**
</description>

<importantNotes>
- (!important!) **Use this tool FREQUENTLY** for any question that requires user input or confirmation.
- (!important!) Continue to generate existing messages after user answers.
- (!important!) Provide predefined options for quick selection if applicable.
- (!important!) **Essential for validating assumptions before proceeding with significant actions (e.g., code edits, running commands).**
</importantNotes>

<whenToUseThisTool>
- When you need clarification on user requirements or preferences
- When multiple implementation approaches are possible and user input is needed
- **Before making potentially impactful changes (code edits, file operations, complex commands)**
- When you need to confirm assumptions before proceeding
- When you need additional information not available in the current context
- When validating potential solutions before implementation
- When facing ambiguous instructions that require clarification
- When seeking feedback on generated code or solutions
- When needing permission to modify critical files or functionality
- **Whenever you feel even slightly unsure about the user's intent or the correct next step.**
</whenToUseThisTool>

<features>
- Pop-up command prompt display for user input
- Returns user response or timeout notification (timeout defaults to ${globalTimeoutSeconds} seconds))
- Maintains context across user interactions
- Handles empty responses gracefully
- Properly formats prompt with project context
</features>

<bestPractices>
- Keep questions concise and specific
- Provide clear options when applicable
- Do not ask the question if you have another tool that can answer the question
  - e.g. when you searching file in the current repository, do not ask the question "Do you want to search for a file in the current repository?"
  - e.g. prefer to use other tools to find the answer (Cursor tools or other MCP Server tools)
- Limit questions to only what's necessary **to resolve the uncertainty**
- Format complex questions into simple choices
- Reference specific code or files when relevant
- Indicate why the information is needed
- Use appropriate urgency based on importance
</bestPractices>
